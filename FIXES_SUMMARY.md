# Dashboard and Theme Fixes Summary

This document describes all the fixes applied to resolve the issues mentioned in the problem statement.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Recent Activity - Wrong Information Display âœ…

**Problem**: 
- Activity log showed "Schedule Request (Approved by admin)" instead of the actual username
- Date was showing as "undefined" instead of actual date like "7Oct"
- No timestamp was shown for when the activity occurred

**Solution**:
- Modified `DashboardTab.tsx` to link schedule request modifications back to the original request data
- Extract the `approved_by` username from the linked request
- Added timestamp formatting using `toLocaleString()` to show dates like "Oct 6, 12:15 PM"
- Fixed date display to show proper dates from the `date_header` field for modifications

**Files Modified**:
- `components/AdminTabs/DashboardTab.tsx`

### 2. Employees Working Today - Shows 0 âœ…

**Problem**:
- The "Employees Working Today" stat card was showing 0 even though 28 employees were working

**Root Cause**:
- Date format mismatch: The code was using ISO format (`2025-10-08`) but the headers use format like `1Oct`, `2Oct`, etc.

**Solution**:
- Fixed date format conversion to match the header format
- Changed from `today.toISOString().split('T')[0]` to `${today.getDate()}${monthNames[today.getMonth()]}`
- Now correctly matches dates and counts working employees

**Files Modified**:
- `components/AdminTabs/DashboardTab.tsx`

### 3. Modified Shifts Count - Shows 0 âœ…

**Problem**:
- Modified Shifts stat was showing 0 when there were actually 5 modifications

**Root Cause**:
- The code was making a second API call and checking for wrong field name (`modified_shifts` instead of `recent_modifications`)

**Solution**:
- Removed duplicate API call
- Used the already-loaded `modifiedRes.recent_modifications` array length
- Fixed count to show actual number of modifications

**Files Modified**:
- `components/AdminTabs/DashboardTab.tsx`

### 4. Stat Card Details - No Data Display âœ…

**Problem**:
- Clicking on stat cards showed only text "Showing pending requests. Click to close." with no actual data
- Modified Shifts had no data to display when clicked

**Solution**:
- Added state variables to store request and modification data
- Created detailed table views for each stat card category:
  - Total Requests: Shows all requests with employee, date, type, status
  - Accepted: Filtered approved requests
  - Rejected: Filtered rejected requests
  - Pending: Filtered pending requests
  - Modified Shifts: Shows employee, date, change (oldâ†’new), and who modified it
- All data displayed in properly formatted tables with theme-aware styling

**Files Modified**:
- `components/AdminTabs/DashboardTab.tsx`

### 5. Admin Theme - Black Wrappers Not Adapting âœ…

**Problem**:
- When Day Light theme was selected, some UI elements remained black
- Text became invisible due to hardcoded backgrounds
- Stat cards had opacity issues making them hard to see

**Solution**:
- Removed hardcoded opacity values (0.2, 0.3) from stat items and activity status
- Fixed CSS to use theme variables that were already in place
- Changed opacity from 0.2 to 1 for better visibility

**Files Modified**:
- `styles/dashboard.css`

### 6. Client Theme - Multiple Issues âœ…

**Problem**:
- Header text "ðŸ›’ Cartup CxP Roster Viewer ðŸ›’" was not visible in light theme
- Employee header sections (showing employee information) remained black
- Transparent black overlays made text hard to read
- App container and shifts panel backgrounds didn't adapt to theme

**Solution**:
- Added `color: var(--theme-text)` to header h1
- Changed `.employee-header` background to use `var(--theme-panel-alt)`
- Changed `.employee-name` from gradient with transparent color to solid `var(--theme-text)`
- Changed `.employee-category` to use theme variables
- Reduced overlay opacity from 0.35 to 0.15 for better readability
- Updated all `:before` pseudo-elements to use theme variables and reduced opacity

**Files Modified**:
- `styles/viewer.css`

## Technical Details

### Date Format Conversion
```javascript
// Before (ISO format):
const todayDateStr = today.toISOString().split('T')[0]; // "2025-10-08"

// After (matching header format):
const monthNames = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'];
const todayDateStr = `${today.getDate()}${monthNames[today.getMonth()]}`; // "8Oct"
```

### Activity Timestamp Display
```javascript
const timestamp = activity.timestamp || activity.approved_at || activity.created_at;
const date = new Date(timestamp);
return date.toLocaleString('en-US', { 
  month: 'short', 
  day: 'numeric', 
  hour: '2-digit', 
  minute: '2-digit'
}); // "Oct 6, 12:15 PM"
```

### Linking Modifications to Requests
```javascript
// Find matching request for modification
const matchingRequest = allRequests.find((r: any) => 
  r.employee_id === m.employee_id && 
  r.date === m.date_header &&
  r.status === 'approved'
);
if (matchingRequest) {
  linkedApprovedBy = matchingRequest.approved_by;
}
```
