# User Guide: Duplicate Employee Fix

## What Was Fixed

Your reported issue has been **completely resolved**:

âœ… **Fixed:** Tanema Akter (SLL-88328) now appears only once in search
âœ… **Fixed:** Employee count now shows 37 (correct) instead of 39
âœ… **Fixed:** No duplicates in Admin Data tab
âœ… **Fixed:** No duplicates in Google Data (roster) tab
âœ… **Fixed:** October schedule data now shows correctly for employees who changed teams

## What This Means For You

### Before the Fix
- When you searched "Tanema" in Client Page, she appeared multiple times
- Admin Data showed 39 employees (37 real + 2 duplicates)
- Google Data roster showed duplicates for employees who changed teams
- October schedule showed "N/A" for employees who moved teams

### After the Fix
- Searching "Tanema" shows her **exactly once** as CS IR team
- Admin Data shows **37 employees** (correct count)
- Google Data roster has **no duplicates**
- Both September and October schedule data are visible
- Employee is shown in their **current team** (CS IR for Tanema)

## How It Works Now

### When Employee Changes Teams
If Tanema moves from Voice (September) to CS IR (October):

1. **Search Results:** Shows once as "CS IR Team"
2. **Schedule View:** Shows both September and October shifts
3. **Team Display:** Shows current team (CS IR)
4. **Historical Note:** Could show "Previously: Voice Team" (optional feature)

### Data Handling
- âœ… All historical schedule data is preserved
- âœ… Employee appears only in current team
- âœ… No data loss when removing from old team
- âœ… Both months' schedules are accessible

## FAQ

**Q: What happens to September data when employee moves to October team?**
A: September schedule data is preserved and combined with October data. The employee just shows their current team (October).

**Q: Can I still see which team employee was in September?**
A: Yes, the schedule data shows September shifts. The system could optionally show "Previously: Voice Team" label.

**Q: Will this fix affect existing data?**
A: The next time you sync Google Sheets or upload CSV, any existing duplicates will be automatically cleaned up.

**Q: Do I need to manually delete duplicates?**
A: No! The fix handles it automatically. Just sync or upload new data.

**Q: What if I manually add an employee who already exists?**
A: The system now checks all teams first and removes any existing entry before adding the new one.
