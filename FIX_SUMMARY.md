# Duplicate Employee Issue - Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
When employees changed teams (e.g., promotions), they appeared as duplicate entries in search results and employee counts were incorrect.

## Files Modified
1. **lib/googleSync.ts** - `merge()` function
2. **lib/rosterMerge.ts** - `mergeCsvIntoGoogle()` function

## Changes Made

### 1. lib/googleSync.ts (36 lines added/changed)
**Before**: When merging data from multiple Google Sheets, employees were not removed from old teams when added to new teams.

**After**: 
- Check if employee exists in ANY other team before adding
- Remove employee from old team when adding to new team
- Use Map-based deduplication to ensure each employee ID appears only once in `allEmployees`

### 2. lib/rosterMerge.ts (10 lines added/changed)
**Before**: Used simple array push for building `allEmployees`, no deduplication.

**After**: 
- Use Map-based deduplication when building `allEmployees`
- Ensures consistency with googleSync.ts approach

## Impact

### Positive Changes
✅ **Search Results**: Searching for an employee now returns exactly 1 result
✅ **Employee Count**: New employee counts are accurate (doesn't count team changes as new employees)
✅ **Admin Panel**: Each employee appears under their current team only
✅ **Data Integrity**: No duplicate employee IDs in the system

### No Breaking Changes
✅ **Build**: Compiles successfully with no errors
✅ **Lint**: No new linting errors introduced
✅ **Existing Data**: Current data remains intact and valid
✅ **Backward Compatible**: No API or data structure changes

## Test Results

All tests pass:
- ✅ Team changes handled correctly (Tanema: VOICE → CS IR)
- ✅ Multiple team changes in same sync
- ✅ Employee staying in same team
- ✅ Data corruption recovery (duplicates in input)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Next.js build

## Example Scenario

**September CSV**: 28 employees
- Tanema Akter (SLL-88328) in VOICE team
- Meena Mojumder (SLL-88479) in TL team

**October CSV**: 37 employees
- Tanema Akter (SLL-88328) in CS IR team (promoted)
- Meena Mojumder (SLL-88479) in TL team (stayed)
- 9 new employees

**Before Fix**:
- Total shown: 39 employees (counted Tanema twice)
- Search "Tanema": 2 results (VOICE, CS IR)
- New employees: 11 (incorrect)

**After Fix**:
- Total shown: 37 employees (correct)
- Search "Tanema": 1 result (CS IR - current team)
- New employees: 9 (correct)

## Deployment Notes

1. **No Migration Required**: Fix applies to future data merges
2. **Existing Data**: Already clean (verified)
3. **Backward Compatible**: No changes to data structure
4. **Safe to Deploy**: All tests pass, build succeeds
