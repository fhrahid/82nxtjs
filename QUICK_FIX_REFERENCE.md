# Quick Fix Reference: Duplicate Employee Issue

## âœ… Issue Fixed
When employees changed teams (e.g., promotions), they appeared as duplicates in the system.

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made
2 files modified with minimal, surgical changes:
- `lib/googleSync.ts` (36 lines)
- `lib/rosterMerge.ts` (10 lines)

## ðŸ“Š What Was Fixed

### Before
```
Search "Tanema" â†’ Shows 2 results:
  1. Tanema - Team: VOICE
  2. Tanema - Team: CS IR

Employee count: 37 shown, but system says 11 new employees
(Should be 9 new - Tanema and Meena were promoted, not new)
```

### After
```
Search "Tanema" â†’ Shows 1 result:
  1. Tanema - Team: CS IR (current team)

Employee count: 37 shown, 9 new employees
(Correct - team changes don't count as new)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Fix Points

1. **Remove from old team**: When an employee moves teams, they're removed from the old team
2. **Map deduplication**: Use JavaScript Map to ensure each employee ID appears only once
3. **Preserve history**: All schedule data across months is preserved

## âœ… Verification
- TypeScript: Compiles âœ…
- Build: Succeeds âœ…
- Tests: All pass âœ…
- No breaking changes âœ…
