# Duplicate Employee Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
When employees changed teams across months (e.g., "Tanema Akter SLL-88328" moving from Voice team in September to CS IR team in October), they appeared multiple times in:
- Employee search results (2-3 duplicate entries)
- Shift View displays
- Calendar views
- Admin Data roster (showing 39 instead of 37 employees)
- Google Data roster

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Google Sheets Sync Issue
**File:** `lib/googleSync.ts`, function: `merge()`
- When syncing multiple Google Sheets (one per month), the merge function would add employees to their new team
- However, it did NOT remove them from their old team
- Result: Employee appears in both Voice (September) and CS IR (October) teams

### 2. Admin Data Sync Issue  
**File:** `lib/dataStore.ts`, function: `setGoogle()`
- When syncing Google data to Admin data, only checked if employee exists in the SAME team
- Did not check if employee exists in OTHER teams
- Result: Employee duplicated across teams in Admin data

### 3. Manual Add Issue
**File:** `app/api/admin/save-employee/route.ts`, action: 'add'
- When manually adding an employee, did not check if they already exist in another team
- Could create duplicates if admin adds employee to different team

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Google Sheets Merge (`lib/googleSync.ts`)
```typescript
// Before adding employee to a team, check ALL other teams
Object.entries(base.teams).forEach(([otherTeam, otherEmps])=>{
  if (otherTeam !== team) {
    const idx = otherEmps.findIndex(e=>e.id===emp.id);
    if (idx > -1) {
      // Employee found in different team, remove them
      base.teams[otherTeam].splice(idx, 1);
    }
  }
});
```

### 2. Fixed Admin Data Sync (`lib/dataStore.ts`)
```typescript
// Check if employee exists in ANY team in adminData
Object.entries(adminData.teams).forEach(([otherTeam, otherEmps])=>{
  if (otherTeam !== teamName) {
    const idx = otherEmps.findIndex(a=>a.id===gEmp.id);
    if (idx > -1) {
      // Employee found in different team, remove them
      adminData.teams[otherTeam].splice(idx, 1);
    }
  }
});
```

### 3. Fixed Manual Employee Add (`app/api/admin/save-employee/route.ts`)
```typescript
if (action==='add') {
  // Check if employee already exists in any team and remove them
  Object.entries(admin.teams).forEach(([t, emps]) => {
    const idx = emps.findIndex(e => e.id === id);
    if (idx > -1) {
      admin.teams[t].splice(idx, 1);
    }
  });
  // Then add to new team
  admin.teams[team].push({name,id,schedule:..., currentTeam:team, team:team});
}
```

### 4. Ensured Consistent Team Property Updates
- Made sure both `currentTeam` and `team` properties are set in all operations
- This ensures consistency across the codebase

## Testing Performed

### Unit Tests Created
1. **test_deduplication.js** - Tests merge() function with team changes
2. **test_setgoogle.js** - Tests setGoogle() employee sync
3. **test_full_flow.js** - Tests complete CSV upload flow with team changes

All tests PASSED ✓

### Test Scenarios Covered
- Employee moves from Voice to CS IR team between months
- Multiple employees with some changing teams
- CSV upload with team changes
- Deduplication in allEmployees array

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix
```
Search for "Tanema":
  1. Tanema Akter (Voice Team) - SLL-88328
  2. Tanema Akter (CS IR Team) - SLL-88328
Total employees: 39 (2 duplicates)
```

### After Fix
```
Search for "Tanema":
  1. Tanema Akter (CS IR Team) - SLL-88328
Total employees: 37 (no duplicates)
```

## Data Integrity Maintained

✓ Employee schedule data preserved across all months
✓ Historical data accessible (September + October shifts)
✓ Current team assignment reflects latest data
✓ No data loss during deduplication

## Files Modified

1. **lib/googleSync.ts** (25 lines changed)
   - Added cross-team deduplication in merge()
   - Ensured currentTeam/team properties are set

2. **lib/dataStore.ts** (37 lines changed)
   - Added cross-team deduplication in setGoogle()
   - Enhanced employee sync logic

3. **app/api/admin/save-employee/route.ts** (10 lines changed)
   - Added deduplication for 'add' action
   - Ensured team properties are consistently set

4. **DUPLICATE_FIX_TESTING.md** (new file)
   - Comprehensive testing guide
   - Test scenarios and expected results

5. **DUPLICATE_FIX_SUMMARY.md** (this file)
   - Complete documentation of the fix

## Backward Compatibility

✓ No breaking changes to API
✓ No changes to data structure
✓ Existing features continue to work
✓ Only fixes the duplication issue

## Performance Impact

Minimal - only adds a loop to check other teams before adding employees:
- O(n*m) where n = number of teams, m = average employees per team
- Typical case: ~6 teams × ~6 employees = ~36 comparisons
- Negligible performance impact

## Deployment Notes

1. **No database migration needed** - data structure unchanged
2. **Existing duplicates** will be cleaned on next data sync/upload
3. **No manual cleanup required** - fix handles it automatically
4. **Safe to deploy** - no breaking changes

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Add UI indicator when employee changes teams ("Previously: Voice Team")
2. Add team change history tracking
3. Add admin notification when duplicate detected and resolved
4. Add data consistency checker in admin panel

## Testing Checklist for User

After deployment:
- [ ] Upload October roster CSV with team changes
- [ ] Verify no duplicates in Admin Data
- [ ] Verify no duplicates in Google Data  
- [ ] Search for Tanema in Client Page - should show once
- [ ] Check total employee count - should be 37
- [ ] Verify schedule shows both September and October data
- [ ] Test manual employee add/edit in admin panel

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check DUPLICATE_FIX_TESTING.md for testing scenarios
2. Run the unit tests in /tmp for verification
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify data files (data/google_data.json, data/admin_data.json)
